## ðŸ”¥ How It Works:

* Mars Grid: The 5x5 grid is generated using div elements styled with CSS.
* Random Obstacles & Samples: The program places obstacles (ðŸš§) and samples (ðŸ”¬) randomly.
* Rover Movement: A for loop iterates through the grid, moving the rover step-by-step.
* Obstacle Detection: If an obstacle is found, the rover skips that position (continue).
* Sample Collection: The rover checks for samples using a do-while loop and collects them.
* Smooth Animation: The setTimeout() function animates the rover moving across the grid.
